I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long. Change must be enacted now on every level to stop police brutality that has repeatedly affected Black communities around the nation.</textarea>

In light of recent events, I would greatly appreciate being briefed on what you personally believe should have happened and how you would carry about the process of those lives that have been lost due to the systemic racism at the hands of police brutality.  How would you specifically carry about the process of charging those parties responsible for these murders had they occurred in our county? As seen in light of recent events, those responsible for the murder of George Floyd were charged at a rate faster than previous occurrences, what institutions does our county have in place for more efficient charging? How are we working with the medical coroners and other agencies to present evidence faster? Such as implementation of looking at previous charges on police officers when they are involved in unlawful killings of unarmed people. Lastly, I would greatly appreciate knowing what systems are in place in our county to continuously keep our officers accountable.</textarea>

                <h6>Message to Police Force (Chiefs of Police, Police Comissioners):</h6>
                <textarea class="form-control" name="police" id="police" rows="5">Protests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.</textarea>

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DIt has been brought to my attention that several members of Congress have been working together to sponsor the Ending Qualified Immunity Act. I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long.

As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

In light of recent events, it is important now, and in the continuing future, for constituents like myself to hold my elected officials accountable and representative of not just my best interests, but that of my community. With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long.

As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DIt has been brought to my attention that several members of Congress have been working together to sponsor the Ending Qualified Immunity Act. I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long. Change must be enacted now on every level to stop police brutality that has repeatedly affected Black communities around the nation.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly.

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long. Change must be enacted now on every level to stop police brutality that has repeatedly affected Black communities around the nation.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DAs a young constituent of this county, it is my responsibility to stay informed and hold accountable the officials that are elected to represent me and my best interests, and this issue is one I care so dearly about. In light of recent events, I would greatly appreciate being briefed on what you personally believe should have happened and how you would carry about the process of those lives that have been lost due to the systemic racism at the hands of police brutality.  How would you specifically carry about the process of charging those parties responsible for these murders had they occurred in our county? As seen in light of recent events, those responsible for the murder of George Floyd were charged at a rate faster than previous occurrences, what institutions does our county have in place for more efficient charging? How are we working with the medical coroners and other agencies to present evidence faster? Such as implementation of looking at previous charges on police officers when they are involved in unlawful killings of unarmed people. Lastly, I would greatly appreciate knowing what systems are in place in our county to continuously keep our officers accountable.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long. Change must be enacted now on every level to stop police brutality that has repeatedly affected Black communities around the nation.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

As seen in light of recent events, those responsible for the murder of George Floyd were charged at a rate faster than previous occurrences, what institutions does our county have in place for more efficient charging? How are we working with the medical coroners and other agencies to present evidence faster?

In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long.

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

I believe ending qualified immunity is an integral step in the right direction to restore Americans’ sentiment in obtaining relief when a police officer violated the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court invented the doctrine in which qualified immunity falls under, overturning the initial Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Congress wrote to allow individuals to sue state and local officials when their rights were violated. Under the Qualified Immunity Act, police are immune from liability, unless the person that they have harmed has proof that there has been a previous case, in the same jurisdiction, involving the same facts and predicaments, for the court to even consider this act to be a constitutional violation. Not only does this let repeated offenders get away with violating the rights of our citizens unless the circumstance matches perfectly, but it does not hold our police officers accountable by law to maintain civil conduct as no two cases will align perfectly. The police remaining politically, culturally, and legally safeguarded from the consequences of violating the rights of the very people they are sworn to protect has gone on for too long.

With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

In light of recent events, it is important now, and in the continuing future, for constituents like myself to hold my elected officials accountable and representative of not just my best interests, but that of my community. With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

In light of recent events, it is important now, and in the continuing future, for constituents like myself to hold my elected officials accountable and representative of not just my best interests, but that of my community. With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

Lastly, I would greatly appreciate knowing what systems are in place in our county to continuously keep our officers accountable.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">

                          Chief of Police Carmen Best:<a href="mailto:opa@seattle.gov?subject=Demands in Light of Recent Events&amp;body=Dear Chief of Police Carmen Best,%0D%0DAs many of my fellow peers and Americans, I am upset and frustrated with the continued mistreatment of the lives of our Black brothers and sisters time and time again falling to the injustice of the police systems nationwide. In light of recent events, it is important now, and in the continuing future, for constituents like myself to hold my elected officials accountable and representative of not just my best interests, but that of my community. With that being said, I am writing to you today to express my perspective and bring forth actionable demands that I feel would benefit the community we live in.%0D%0DProtests around the country have been going on due to the recent police brutality events that have shocked the nation and disrupted Black communities across the states. As a concerned citizen, I believe that systemic changes can be made in police districts to put an end to police brutality once and for all. I would like to hear your intended plan of action to counteract the issue above. As a concerned citizen, I have outlined some changes that I believe will be instrumental in preventing police brutality. My first request is that police de-escalation training be longer in duration. The average de-escalation training for police officers is 2 hours per year, and it is my firm belief that this is not enough time to adequately equip police officers with the tools and techniques to properly handle high-stress situations. By increasing the requirement for de-escalation training to 2-4 hours a quarter, it would better prepare police officers for any potentially stressful situations, furthermore, preventing the shooting of unarmed citizens, particularly those in the Black community. Additionally, I encourage you to consider adding better diversity and inclusion educational requirements to all police officer training. This could include taking classes that  educate potential police officers on systematic racism and policing in at-risk communities. Such classes would help reduce and even eliminate the racial biases currently present in the police force. Whether this education is obtained through an associate degree in criminal justice or third-party institute classes, this will help in decreasing inhumane and unlawful killings. My last request is that stronger punishment be implemented for the use of excessive and unlawful force by police officers. It should be known that actions such as kneeling on a pleading person’s neck or choke-holding people without proper cause will not be tolerated. Officers should know if they engage in such targeted and inhumane actions they will be met with the swift hand of justice-- immediate termination, or time off during investigation without pay. It is my strong belief that implementing changes like the ones outlined above will help in not only eradicating police brutality, but also result in a more just police force and safer community for all.%0D%0DSincerely,%0DConcerned Citizen" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="email.png" height="40px">
